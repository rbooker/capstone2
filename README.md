# capstone2
My second capstone project for the Springboard software engineering bootcamp. It's a website I designed for the (sadly now defunct) streaming radio station I hosted a show on for five years. I think it's a bit of an improvement on the original (other than the fact that mine doesn't actually stream music - a minor detail).
